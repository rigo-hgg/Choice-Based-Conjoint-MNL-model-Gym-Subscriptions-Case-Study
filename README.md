Among the public places hardest hit by the lockdown to try to bring down the rate of coronavirus, there are certainly gyms, which have been closed since October and will probably be the last business to reopen. In order to understand which are the factors on which one can invest to relaunch the sector, survey participants are asked to choose one of different subscription profiles. The various types of subscription include:
- subscription duration (monthly / three-months / yearly)
- type of activities (only fitness room / fitness room plus courses)
- time slots in which the costumer can access the structure (7-12 / 18-23 / all day)
- type of training schedule (standard / personalized) 
- additional services (not included / access to the wellness center / physiotherapy consultancy)
- corresponding price per month (40 euros / 60 euros / 80 euros)

The aim of the data analysis is to assess the relationship between the choice and the product attributes. To do this a discrete choice model has been used, such as the multinomial logit regression.

The original code has been written in R.
